# 3D-Engine-in-C
Here we go, let's make 3D Engine in C. Why won't I do it in the easier programming languages like Python? Because I like challenges lol (this will be a long ride, help).
Every day I will write about my progress.

- C is literally one of the worst languages I could write a 3D engine,
